// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

def Sum(x, y):
    return x + y

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

def number_type(x):
    if x % 2 == 2:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

number_type(562)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) num_list[num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]
b) Sum = sum(num_list)
   Average = Sum % 5
c)  min(num_list)
    max(num_list)
d) step B creates a variable name for the sum function which will take the sum of the num_list list. Then, Average will call on the Sum variable we created and divide it by 5;
step C uses the python defined min and max function to call on the num_list and calculate the minimum and maximum number in the list
